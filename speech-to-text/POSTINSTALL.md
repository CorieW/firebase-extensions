## See it in action

1. Go to your project's Storage Bucket in the Google Firebase console.
2. Add a new file. Depending on your configuration during the installation, the transcriptions will be saved as a new .txt file with the same name, in the same Cloud Storage path.

## Monitoring

As a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.
