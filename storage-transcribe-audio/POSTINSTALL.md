### See it in action
1. Go to your project's [Storage Bucket](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/${PROJECT_ID}/storage/${EXTENSION_BUCKET}) in the Google Firebase console.
2. Add a new file. Depending on your configuration during the installation, the transcriptions will be saved either in your Firestore collection or as new files in your Cloud Storage bucket.


### Monitoring
As a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.
